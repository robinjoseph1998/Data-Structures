Markdown
GitBook supports Markdown directly in the editor, so you can quickly and easily create content using common syntax.

GitBook’s editor allows you to create formatted content using Markdown.

Markdown is a popular markup syntax that’s widely known for its simplicity. GitBook supports it as a keyboard-friendly way to write rich and structured text.

You can learn more about Markdown itself by visiting Common Mark.

Text formatting
GitBook supports all the classic inline Markdown formatting:

Formatting	Markdown version	Result
Bold

**bold**

text

Italic

_italic_

italic

Strikethrough

~strikethrough~

strikethrough

Titles
Heading 1: # A first-level title

Heading 2: ## A second-level title

Heading 3: ### A third-level title

Code blocks
```⏎ creates a new code block.

```py⏎ creates a new code block with Python syntax highlighting.

We use Prism for syntax highlighting. You can use Test Drive Prism to check which languages Prism supports. If you notice a mismatch between GitBook and Prism, there’s a chance we’re a version or two behind. We’ll catch up soon!

Lists
GitBook automatically detects and creates ordered and unordered lists as you type.

Begin a line with -  or *  to start an unordered bullet list.

Begin a line with 1.  to start a numbered list. 

Begin a line with - [ ] to start a task list.

When writing any kind of list, hit Tab to add a indent, and Shift+Tab to outdent.

Quotes
Begin a line with >  to create a block quote. If you select an entire paragraph from start to end, typing > will wrap the content in a block quote.

This is a block quote.

Dividers
Type --- then hit Enter to create a divider on your page. 

This is an example of a divider.
