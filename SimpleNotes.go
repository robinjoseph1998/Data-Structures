package main

//(1)::::::::to convert rune to its corresponding character value:::::::::::

// i:=108

// charValue:=string(i)

// fmt.Println("Corresponding Character Value Is", charValue)

//(2)::::::CHANNELS:::::::

// var ch chan int  - This just reserves a spot for a channel, but it's not ready yet.

// ch := make(chan int) - This creates a new channel and makes it ready to use.

// In practical terms, the second approach (ch := make(chan int))
// is more common because it's a quick and easy way to create a
// usable channel in a single line of code.
